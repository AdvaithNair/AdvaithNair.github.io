It's a cool little project with some average CSS, but nothing good. I used class-based React components and JavaScript, so I'm not entirely proud of this one. But I learned quite a lot from this project. The jump from Aglet to RANT was quite impressive if I'm going to be honest, so clearly in that time, I learned a good amount.",
